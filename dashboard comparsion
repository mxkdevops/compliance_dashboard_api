Category	myCompliance.me (Top Image)	FastAPI Compliance Dashboard (Bottom Image)
Branding / Header	• Company logo (“mycompliance.me”)
• Top navigation bar with blue background
• User info (“Welcome demo.my”), help, bell icon, and settings gear
• Compliance counters (Due / Not Compliant) with red/orange squares	• Simple header “Compliance Dashboard (FastAPI)”
• Deep blue strip with summary metrics (Sites, Active Sites, Active PPM, Overdue, etc.)
• No logo yet, minimal branding
Color Scheme	• Primary blue for header/background
• Green = Compliant, Amber = Due Soon, Red = Non-Compliant
• White cards with green/orange/red top labels	• Primary deep blue header
• Green border = OK, Amber = Due Soon, Red = Due/Overdue
• White cards with color-coded border
Layout	• Multi-row card grid per site (each site = left blue panel + horizontal strip of compliance areas like Electrical, Fire, etc.)
• Each cell = individual compliance item (Electrical, Fire, etc.) with due status	• Masonry-style grid: one rectangular card per site summarising compliance status
• Sidebar on right shows details/PPM of selected site
Data Structure	• Site → multiple compliance categories displayed side by side in rows
• Each category shows “Order issued”, “Works complete”, “Next due”, “Documents”	• Site summary card shows aggregate state (min next due, active PPM count, status color)
• Detailed PPM list (Fire Alarms, Gas, Water, etc.) visible in right sidebar on click
Interactivity	• “Sort By”, “Search”, date filters, “Go”, “My Report” buttons
• Collapsible site panels (arrow down)
• Possibly AJAX-based refresh	• Live filtering (search, dropdown filters auto-update)

• Real-time save via PATCH API
Metrics / Summary Tiles	• Compliance counters (Due = orange, Not Compliant = red) in top bar	• Multiple metrics in header (Sites, Active Sites, Active PPM, Overdue, Due next 30d, Compliant vs Non-Compliant Sites)
Navigation / Pages	• Likely multi-page (reports, documents, alerts, etc.)	• Single-page web app (FastAPI serving HTML + API) with an extra admin page for editing sites
Visual Hierarchy	• Strong “traffic light” system (green OK, amber soon, red due)
• Dense information per row	• Clean, modern, more white space, simpler color usage (border colors instead of full fills)
Additional Icons	• Envelope/mail icon per site, “Documents” links, report icons	• Minimal icons; text-based interface; plan to add icons later (for documents, mail, etc.)
Purpose / Focus	• Commercial compliance platform (focus on visual compliance per discipline for FM/contractors)	• In-house or prototype dashboard (focus on analytics, editing, automation, API integration)
